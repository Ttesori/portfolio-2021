# Portfolio Website - 2021
This website is used to provide an overview of me, my skills, and my development experience.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS

The website is based upon a simple HTML5 template, but has been highly edited for use with my personal branding. SASS variables make development much faster and easier, and a custom font really makes the website feel warm and personal.

## Lessons Learned:

As someone who likes having control over all aspects of design and code, building this site upon a template was a challenge to me. There were things I noticed that I would personally do differently, but I wanted to get this website up quickly so it could serve its purpose of introducing me as a developer, and so I could not let perfect be the enemy of good!
